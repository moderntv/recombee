// MergeUsers merges interactions (purchases, ratings, bookmarks, detail views â€¦) of two different users under a single

// account, yet accesses the system anonymously while, e.g., putting items into a shopping cart. At some point in time,
// such as when the user wishes to confirm the purchase, (s)he logs into the system using his/her username and password.
// The interactions made under anonymous session ID then become connected with the persistent account, and merging these
// two becomes desirable.

// the source user are attributed to the target user, and the source user is deleted.
